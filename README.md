# MyFirstApp
We all like to keep our first ever application we've buit.

So in this repository, which I built a couple of years now, I'm going to share with you guys my fisrt beautiful application,
which is not only my fist application in JavaScript but it's actually my fist application
as a programmer.

I know the source code is extremely poor, but many advanced JavaScript dev would suffer
building it, if couldn't of course.
