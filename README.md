# MyFirstApp
We all like to keep our first ever application we've built.

So in this repository, which I built a couple of years now, I'm going to share with you guys my fisrt beautiful application,
which is not only my first application in JavaScript but it's actually my fist application
as a programmer.

I know the source code is extremely poor, but the logic is pretty cool, and I'm sure  many advanced JavaScript devs would suffer
building it, if couldn't of course.

Please try to quickly hover over those items to see that kind of wave.

here is it:
